    <h2 id="contracts">Contracts</h2>
    <p>From the official <i>Rules & FAQ</i> document, Contracts Event are defined as an event similar to "Secret Santa", but the gifts are switched to series recommendations.</p>
    
    <p>In this specific event, starting from the Winter season of 2024, they implemented an EXP system, earned through finishing contracts each season, and mostly through a bounty system, which can be ranked from E-Rank to S-Rank.</p>

    <p>These EXP system are, personally, just something like a trust point, since bounty are raffled and for some of them (most likely expensive games) you need specific EXP ranks, which can be attained after reaching certain EXPs.</p>
