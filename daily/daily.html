    <h2>Day 1 (January 1st, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Here we come, 2024.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I only thought of this project in the back of my mind. Some sort of reprise of the unreleased (maybe I'll release it here somewhat) Two Thousand Twenty Words project.</p>

    <p>I do know much better now though. How it's impossible for me to really do it daily, but I can try.</p>
    <p>This day, I spent most of it in the house that's not my home, watching fireworks from high up and sleeping in an air mattress. The classic experience of "camping" without actually getting bitten by mosquitos.</p>

    <p>Then we got home and sleep even more. Oh, and I also read mangas. Specifically starting on <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i>, or <i>The Dangers in My Heart</i>. Fluffy series, quirky pairing. I'll be watching the anime for this soon, after I catch up. Season 2 incoming.</p>
    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 2 (January 2nd, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Learnt a bit about how to spruce up the website. Thank you, mentor.</p>
    <p>Contracts are starting to shape up. I'll share my calculation on the EXP I'm getting here.<a href="dailyref.html#contracts"><sup>*</sup></a></p>

    <pre>
    Base Contract : 500XP (First 60 chapters)
    Staff Contract : 700XP (Season 1)
    Overachiever (Base) : 50XP (next 60 chapters) + 50XP (next 60 chapters, 
    currently it's 180 chapters)
    Overachiever (Staff) : 50XP (Season 2) + 50XP (Season 3) + 50XP? (Movie?

    <h2>Day 3 (January 3rd, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Had to help my sister fix a tablet today. I did leave yesterday too, but I don't feel like saying it in the entry. Now I have to, since this makes it two days in a row where I have to go out.</p>

    <p>I'm also feeling a bit low energy, might be sick.</p>

    <p>Also I tried reading <i>Fate/strange fake</i>, but realized that this is something I can only read after... reading all these.</p>
    <pre>
        >Fate/stay night (Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, Heaven's Feel)
        >Fate/Zero
        >The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II
        >Fate/Grand Order (up to Babylonia of Arc 1)
        >Tsuhikime Remake
    </pre>

    <p>Safe to say, this novel will be unread for a <i>long</i> time.</p>

    <p>This novel isn't supposed to be something I read first anyway. There's <i>Imouto sae Ireba Ii</i> (or <i>Imosae</i>) light novel series with deadline of day 116 (April 25th, 2024), and my ever growing backlog of Brandon Sanderson's novels. <i>Defiant</i>, reread of <i>Mistborn</i> from Era 1 up to the newest <i>The Lost Metal</i>, and <i>The Sunlit Man</i>... let me make another list.</p>

    <pre>
        >Imouto sae Ireba Ii (3/14)
        >Defiant
        >Hero of Ages (reread)
        >Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, Bands of Mourning, The Lost Metal 
        (reread, preferrably all immediately after the other)
        >The Sunlit Man
    </pre>

    <p>There's also this bubbling idea of taking every single beer mentions from <i>Imosae</i> and their pic and their in-novel description in comparison to that.</p> 
    
    <p>Or an idea to put in timestamp to the last time a page in this website is updated. This requires me to tinker with AJAX, which seems simple... let's see if this works. (Update, it works!)</p>

    <p>But I have too many ideas.</p>

    <p>This project is already one of my many ideas, I'm not even sure this'll last until halfway through the year, but I'll try to keep up. The goal for this project is to not do it daily, but doing it as much as I am comfortable.</p>

    <p>Last minute update: someone bought me <i>Watanagashi</i>, the second episode of the visual novel <i>Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni</i>, so my plans for all these are out of the window for now. I'll just read them, along with the first episode <i>Onikakushi</i> (which I have read before, but I will read again for posterity). This might help my heart handle <i>The Letter</i>, perhaps, since this visual novel is... <i>scary</i>.</p>

    <h2>Day 4 (January 4, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Woke up with a fever today, even though I have a make up class to go to. Decided to stay home.</p>

    <p>Burned up a bit at noon, had some weird dreams. Always had those when I'm sick, but yeah. Stuck in bed for the most part of the day. Read up some manga, no progress on games. Still not reading my contract. I should get on that.</p>

    <p>Having trouble eating, but ended up eating a bit. Opened up some anime to soothe myself. Finally started <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i> anime, hopefully able to finish the season before the season 2 drops on day 7.</p>

    <p>Also watched <i>Mato Seihei no Slave</i> anime. It looks low-budget, but I'll be there until the end, for all the "rewards" scene. They don't skimp out on those... but they do skimp on the actual action scenes though. Shame.</p>

    <p>Didn't put this in yesterday but I managed to finish the second season of <i>Arknights</i> anime, or we can say <i>Arknights: Perish in Frost</i> for the full name. FrostNova part still got me, even now. Glad that the anime at least able to do that for me, and glad that I have another anime under my belt.</p>

    <p>My process of culturing myself starting to bear fruit. Nothing else to report other than that.</p>
    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 5 (January 5, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Worked on the beer page for Imosae, as I started volume 4. Kaiko.... anyway, I'll just work on it more.</p>

    <p>Continued watching <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i> anime, episode 5 through 8. I'm on time to watch it before the season 2 drops in Sunday, day 7.</p>

    <p>Got a movie groupwatch today, working our way through films directed by the honorable Christopher Nolan. We went on watching his premiere debut film <i>Following</i> a week ago, and now doing a double feature of his iconic film, <i>Memento</i>, and the Norwegian film adapatation <i>Insomnia</i>.</p>

    <p>Memento was as mind bending as his later movies be, especially in the likes of Tenet or Inception. The way the movie is structured was supposed to represent how life like for the main character Lenny, who is afflicted by Anterograde Amnesia. He is played by Guy Pearce, and honestly it gave me fear to watch someone basically losing his memories after a couple of minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Someone could just mouth you off and treats you like shit, deprive you of methods you can use to try and remember it, and then once you forget, acts like another person entirely to throw you off. This happened to Lenny in the movie, and the thought made me shiver.</p>

    <p>The other movie are about a case in Alaska, investigated by two LAPD officers doing it out of a favor. The setting of this movie doesn't interest me at first, but once the inciting incident happens, which was Al Pacino's character, Det. Will Dormer, accidentally shooting his partner through the fog, we were treated by a compelling story about guilt, justice, and the depravity of a man willing to do whatever's necessary to get to his goal.</p>

    <p>Both movies have this distinct style that I recognize to be Nolan's fingerprint. Quick flashes or cuts to a scene when people are talking about a specific memory, or the way the action scene is set to be as realistic as possible... I was his fans only through his famous films, but his earlier films are just as good, if not better than I expected it to be.</p>

    <p>His entire filmography is quite the list, and we're only in the first few films he made. Tomorrow we're planning to take on another two movies, one of which is part of the trilogy that made me aware of his names, <i>The Dark Knight Trilogy</i>, starting with <i>Batman Begins</i>, and then also <i>The Prestige</i> if we feel up for it.</p>

    <p>Also, we were treated to a Tomska sketch in between the two movies, and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0WynQgUlWo">this video</a> after watching Memento is quite funny, for some reason.</p>

    <h2>Day 6 (January 6, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Today I felt like an idiot, worrying about the deadline of projects when it turns out there is no deadline today. All my friends are sitting calmly while I lost my shit.</p>

    <p>Due to above, I was unable to get to watch <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i> anime to completion, so I'll miss the premiere of the second season. It's a shame, but I can catch up the day after tomorrow, because tomorrow I'll be busy.</p>

    <p>Today we managed to finish <i>Batman Begins</i>, and after the umpteenth time of watching this movie it only clicks to me now how... the movie is filled with explosion for some reason. I never really rated this movie that high to begin with, as it is probably the lowest rated one out of the trilogy (which is a common take), but it's pretty sad that the movie doesn't get better on a rewatch.</p>
    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 7 (January 7, 2024)</h2>
    <p>I was busy the whole day, driving for my aunt's family to buy some things, and I was back by 5pm.</p>

    <p>Watched The Prestige by nightfall. I'll just let my letterboxd review say it all.</p>

    <pre>
The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The movie starts itself by telling us its structure, 
framing it as the way magic acts work, and the whole narrative adheres to the structure down to the tee. 
The movie managed to reveal the Pledge, Turn, and Prestige of the story perfectly, as it delves deep 
into two rival magicians whose life interconnects with each other through magic acts, deaths, and 
the allure of delivering the perfect Prestige.

    <h2>Day 8 (January 8, 2024)</h2>

    <p><i>Magus of the Library</i> is a 10/10. I'll put in my thoughts here even though this is supposed to be a contract, which should be put on my contract review portion of the website, but I'll put it here nonetheless for future references. I have grand ideas about how I want to pour my love for this series, because it was a magnificent story.</p>

    <p>Every chapter of the manga is very dense, 60-80 pages. It doesn't get translated monthly, we have to wait until whenever the english volume is out for me to continue the story, but goddamn the story itself is so good.</p>

    <p>The art is approaching the level of greatness that <i>Witch Hat Atelier</i> does. Worldbuilding rivals western novels, and it is very appropriate because the story itself concerns books and libraries, so they make sure to really give you a proper world for you to understand.</p>

    <p>The characters... man, the characters themselves are peak as well. They're all thirteen years old and varied, yet I can't help but already root for them <i>ALL</i>, that's right, even the designated character that you're not supposed to like yet. Their design are articulate, based on the fictional races which I now know is based on real life.</p>

    <p>History of this world is layered, intrigue surrounding the power system is tight, I can talk a lot about it, but I'll keep it in until I finally properly reached the end of the current chapters. I only read 20/29 chapters currently out, and I'm already thinking that this is a 10/10 manga.</p>

    <p>Anyway... now that is out of the way, I'll update you on some things. I finally finished <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i> anime! It was fluffy up until the last second, and I can't wait to watch the first episode of season 2 as well, but now that I finished this, it became one of many animes this season I'm watching weekly.</p>

    <pre>
    - Frieren cour 2
    - Solo Leveling
    - Mato Seihei no Slave
    - Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu
    </pre>

    <p>This won't be all I'm watching this season though, just the one that is airing. My plans for this season, and probably would be for the rest of the year, is to finish off my planned to watch/planned to read list. For PTW, it includes, in order of personal importance:</p>

    <pre>
    - Zom 100 (last three ep)
    - Dead Mount Death Play (both part)
    - 100gf (6/12)
    - CSM (4/12)
    - SxF season 2
    - My Dress Up Darling (2/12)
    - 86 (both part)
    - Komi (both season)
    - Scott Pilgrim Takes Off
    - Belle (movie)
    </pre>

    <p>This list will change as I usually don't adhere to a strict list, especially those written down, but instead will impulsively do whatever I want. I really need to fix this, or control it somewhat...</p>

    <p>Also, I actually didn't talk about this before but I've been reading mangas as well during these one week, including <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i> (which I managed to read up to chapter 100 before starting). Today, I was able to finish off <i>Watari-kun no xx ga Houkai Sunzen</i>, which just ended and revealed that it would have an anime adaptation of, probably meaning it'll air sometime this year or early next year. I'll let my Anilist comment on the series be my comment as a whole about the series.</p>

    <pre>
barring two extra chapters, this is basically finished for now. the manga is... very dramatic, 
and not in a good way either. 
by the end, I didn't feel as good even after everyone reached their happy ending in a way, 
I can't really pinpoint my problem with it though.
</pre>

    <p>...okay I'll elaborate. The thing is, this manga is a romance, a typical triangle between a childhood friend and a prim and proper girlfriend. There was no doubt about it that I was behind Satsuki being the winner, but the way they go about it is pretty... weird. Convoluted? I don't know if it's because of the scanlation that I was served on, but the story just became something I can't get myself invested on...</p>

    <p>Well, with that out of the way, Ishihara (the other girl who loses) gets a goddamn makeover after her heart gets broken, and now I don't know who I fucking like anymore... I mean... she wore a CHOKER... it's my weakness...</p>

    <p>And lastly, there's some update regarding stories that I put on this website as well. Remember Stickverse? I 'member. It was dormant for two years because I don't feel like going back to it, but now that a stray thought came over me, I reviewed a story that I wrote on my google notes, basically the original 'Shadows' story in my language, and I feel like translating it properly this time.</p>

    <p>The first chapter that I put up on this website is a shoddy work at trying to translate it. I prefer the way I did mine in the original language, it flows better... but I have a nagging feeling that it's because I wrote it in a language I was more comfortable in, and it will lose a lot of its flavor trying to translate it to English.</p>
    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 9 (January 9, 2024)</h2>
    <p>I finished <i>Last Game</i>, a romance manga set in college about a rich boy trying to make his childhood friend, a stone cold airhead that doesn't understand feelings.</p>

    <p>Compared to <i>Watari-kun</i>, this was a slightly better romance, but this time kinda limited by the source being old and kinda beat up, since this is a monthly series starting in 2011. Having them being legible in the first place is surprising in on itself.</p>
    
    <p>Is it wrong to say that this is a shoujo manga with a guy being the shojo MC? Yanagi, the male MC, was the one fidgeting and trying for basically all throughout the manga, aware of romance tropes, heck, his reactions to the cool Kujou playing straight into a romance trope was definitely something you would see on a traditionally female character...</p>

    <p>But he's still an ikemen. When he needs to be cool, goddamn does this dude can do it.</p>
    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 10 (January 10, 2024)</h2>
    <p>MatPat's retiring. That's... pretty sad to think about. It's been more than half a decade since I know him, more than the time I know Tom Scott (which was during COVID), and this was sadder than that.</p>

    <p>Everyone seems to be burning out this year, or just coincidentally planning on retiring this year for some reason...</p>

    </hgroup>

    <hgroup>
    <h2>Day 11 (January 11, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Been really down the past few days, just sleeping on my bed. Before sleeping yesterday I forced myself to watch <i>Dead Mount Death Play</i> anime. Was not really the first thing on my list I have to watch, but I feel like it (this will be a common reoccurence throughout, so watch out).</p>

    <p>Also Contracts update, I played a bit of <i>Darkest Dungeon</i>. Six hours in, and I'm not even close to finishing it, and I'm STILL at the easiest difficulty, trying things out. I need to speed things up.</p>

    <p>I've downloaded the other two games, <i>Rise of Tomb Raider</i>, and <i>The Letter</i>, but I have not touched them. The only thing I did try was a few minutes of the first <i>Tomb Raider</i>, as part of my bid to overachieve on the <i>Rise</i> bounty.</p>

    <p>I almost finished on Magus, stopping now because it was a good part to stop on the story, with some major reveal. I'll continue as soon as I am able to figure out what my contract review shape would be.</p>

    <p>I checked out the first ten chapter of <i>Your Throne</i>. This will probably be the next thing I'm reading, probably when I'm feeling like it. I ended up reading the first four chapters of <i>Imosae</i> instead yesterday, so my sense of priority is already out of whack.</p>
