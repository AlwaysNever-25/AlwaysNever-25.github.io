    <h2>Day 1 (January 1st, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Here we come, 2024.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I only thought of this project in the back of my mind. Some sort of reprise of the unreleased (maybe I'll release it here somewhat) Two Thousand Twenty Words project.</p>

    <p>I do know much better now though. How it's impossible for me to really do it daily, but I can try.</p>
    <p>This day, I spent most of it in the house that's not my home, watching fireworks from high up and sleeping in an air mattress. The classic experience of "camping" without actually getting bitten by mosquitos.</p>

    <p>Then we got home and sleep even more. Oh, and I also read mangas. Specifically starting on <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i>, or <i>The Dangers in My Heart</i>. Fluffy series, quirky pairing. I'll be watching the anime for this soon, after I catch up. Season 2 incoming.</p>

    <h2>Day 2 (January 2nd, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Learnt a bit about how to spruce up the website. Thank you, mentor.</p>
    <p>Contracts are starting to shape up. I'll share my calculation on the EXP I'm getting here.<a href="dailyref.html#contracts"><sup>*</sup></a></p>

    <pre>
    Base Contract : 500XP (First 60 chapters)
    Staff Contract : 700XP (Season 1)
    Overachiever (Base) : 50XP (next 60 chapters) + 50XP (next 60 chapters, currently it's 180 chapters)
    Overachiever (Staff) : 50XP (Season 2) + 50XP (Season 3) + 50XP? (Movie? not sure about this)
    
    Bounties:
    S-Rank (Darkest Dungeon) : 1000XP (main objective) + 250XP (additional objective)

    E-Rank (Magus of the Library) : 100XP (main objective)

    <h2>Day 3 (January 3rd, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Had to help my sister fix a tablet today. I did leave yesterday too, but I don't feel like saying it in the entry. Now I have to, since this makes it two days in a row where I have to go out.</p>

    <p>I'm also feeling a bit low energy, might be sick.</p>

    <p>Also I tried reading <i>Fate/strange fake</i>, but realized that this is something I can only read after... reading all these.</p>
    <pre>
        >Fate/stay night (Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, Heaven's Feel)
        >Fate/Zero
        >The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II
        >Fate/Grand Order (up to Babylonia of Arc 1)
        >Tsuhikime Remake
    </pre>

    <p>Safe to say, this novel will be unread for a <i>long</i> time.</p>

    <p>This novel isn't supposed to be something I read first anyway. There's <i>Imouto sae Ireba Ii</i> (or <i>Imosae</i>) light novel series with deadline of day 116 (April 25th, 2024), and my ever growing backlog of Brandon Sanderson's novels. <i>Defiant</i>, reread of <i>Mistborn</i> from Era 1 up to the newest <i>The Lost Metal</i>, and <i>The Sunlit Man</i>... let me make another list.</p>

    <pre>
        >Imouto sae Ireba Ii (3/14)
        >Defiant
        >Hero of Ages (reread)
        >Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, Bands of Mourning, The Lost Metal (reread, preferrably all immediately after the other)
        >The Sunlit Man
    </pre>

    <p>There's also this bubbling idea of taking every single beer mentions from <i>Imosae</i> and their pic and their in-novel description in comparison to that.</p> 
    
    <p>Or an idea to put in timestamp to the last time a page in this website is updated. This requires me to tinker with AJAX, which seems simple... let's see if this works</p>

    <p>But I have too many ideas.</p>

    <p>This project is already one of my many ideas, I'm not even sure this'll last until halfway through the year, but I'll try to keep up. The goal for this project is to not do it daily, but doing it as much as I am comfortable.</p>
