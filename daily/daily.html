    <h2>Day 1 (January 1st, 2024)</h2>
    <p>Here we come, 2024.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I only thought of this project in the back of my mind. Some sort of reprise of the unreleased (maybe I'll release it here somewhat) Two Thousand Twenty Words project.</p>

    <p>I do know much better now though. How it's impossible for me to really do it daily, but I can try.</p>
    <p>This day, I spent most of it in the house that's not my home, watching fireworks from high up and sleeping in an air mattress. The classic experience of "camping" without actually getting bitten by mosquitos.</p>

    <p>Then we got home and sleep even more. Oh, and I also read mangas. Specifically starting on <i>Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu</i>, or <i>The Dangers in My Heart</i>. Fluffy series, quirky pairing. I'll be watching the anime for this soon, after I catch up. Season 2 incoming.</p>
