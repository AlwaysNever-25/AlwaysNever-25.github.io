    </header>
    <p>AlwaysNever-25, also known as Al. <br>
    Born sometime after Y2K, he's a boy with no knowledge at all regarding website. <br>
    Until he did something crazy. Jumped immediately... into Wikia. <br>
    Well, he thought he did something, with uploading images of weapons from this old Zombie MMO game called The Last Stand: Dead Zone. <br>
    Boy howdy, bless his soul, he got sidetracked by a zombie game, for fuck's sake. Anyway. <br>
    Time flies. He go through some shit, namely, High School and College. <br>
    He sleep through class, yet somehow he ended up being the fourth best in his class by the end of the senior year? What? <br>
    Yeah, don't know how the fuck that happened. His interest piqued again as he get to edit another wiki. <br>
    A name now forgotten. He met some cool person with wizard knowledge on HTML and CSS, and a reddit moderator. Bless <i>his</i> soul. <br>
    He then learn the beautiful world of HTML and CSS, and basically, front-end development. Found some kind of purpose, but also he's still into this Wikia shit first. <br>
    After the now forgotten Wiki is abandoned, he jumped ship into other wikis. Editing like crazy. <br>
    Somehow got admin in three different wikis, even founded one of those. <s>It would've been four if he was smart enough but he's not</s> <br>
    By then he already familiar with the structure of Wikia, now branded as Fandom.  <br> He learns how to apply those pesky CSS to the whole wiki, applying script from Dev Wiki to his own, and feverishly editing like a madman to a wiki that perhaps nobody even look at. <br>
    And then you know what? He got to a bootcamp. After all that shit, he finally uses his brain and start applying those skills to a real world equivalent, not just in his brain. <br>
    Perhaps, later on, he can actually apply it to real world as well, things in his mind. <br>
