        <p>The Fifth is a friend I made during highschool, right after The Fourth left.</p>

        <p>If I was given a choice, I would choose to not meet this person, this shadow.</p>

        <p>But during this time, especially after she left, my other option were to be a loner, and ends up being a shadow of my own self.</p>

        <p>And so I made the option to befriend someone.</p>

        <p>It was just a chance meeting, as we entered the second year. The students gets mixed around as we advanced another grade, and he happens to be my seatmates, sitting in the back of the class.</p>

        <p>We bonded over games and talking about sports... and sometimes talking about our classmates. From our talk, I figured out that this friend of mine also has the same thought process as me. For us to survive during this period, we needed someone to back us up.</p>

        <p>He became the person I rely on to remind me of homework, as I do the same to him if he ever forgets. We eat lunch together, and it seems like he doesn't have any other friends other than me.</p>

        <p>But I still hold myself back. I was already betrayed once, there's no way in hell I will get caught with my pants down again.</p>

        <p>This way, with a clear head, I was able to see the betrayal way before it happens.</p>

        <p>In the end of my second year, I found out that this friend of mine has talked shit behind my back to other students, the infamous ones. Apparently, this infamous group of students spread a rumor around that I was responsible for how hard it is to approach the Fourth, and this friend joins in on discussing, and falsely confirming the rumor. It seems like he sensed an opportunity to be a part of them and seized it.</p>

        <p>I happened to overhear him talk about me as I went home for the last time during that second year. I didn't get enraged at the time. A particular memory keeps popping up every time my emotion balls up, of a familiar face, and the phantom feeling on my arms. I managed to calm myself. There's no need to be as aggressive as before.</p>

        <p>Just like before, though, they are all cowards. The only thing differentiating them is their numbers far overwhelm those I faced before. And this friend of mine wanted to join, perhaps as a self-preservation before he gets bullied himself.</p>

        <p>They're only talking behind my back, however. There's nothing else going on, at least, that's what I think at first.</p>

        <p>Because not long after that, the sixth shadow emerges because I didn't act on my feelings.</p>
