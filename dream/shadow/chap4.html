        <p>The Fourth is my biggest regret. I do not want her to be my shadow, and as a result, she is the "brightest" shadow out of all, because deep down I wish we can meet again in the distant future.</p>

        <p>She is a dear friend, different from the rest, and she is the only one I can truly call friend from the deepest part of my heart.</p>

        <p>During my High School era, I managed to get in to a prestigious international high-school, tying in to my father's upward trajectory in his job.</p>

        <p>And in this school, they have a student exchange program with foreign high school all across the world.</p>

        <p>In this particular language class, I was paired with her. Contrary to my expectations, she can actually speak my language, albeit not as fluently. I also can speak her foreign language, and perhaps I was also not as fluent. We became partners just for that particular class, at first.</p>

        <p>After weeks of classes went by, at some point we started exchanging contacts with each other.</p>

        <p>We started corresponding with each other regularly, speaking in each other's language, and correcting each other when we were wrong. We also started to talk freely about other topics outside of school subjects.</p>

        <p>Our communication gets clearer as time goes on. I can speak her language without stuttering, and she can speak in my language fluently, without any hint of an accent.</p>

        <p>One day, out of the blue, she asked me out to eat somewhere.</p>

        <p>At that age, I wasn't as oblivious as to not understand the implication of this request, but I agreed to meet up anyway.</p>

        <p>We both meet up at a coffee shop, and at first, there was some awkwardness. This is our first time meeting up outside of school anyway, and if I can guess, she also realizes what it means to meet up with just the two of us. But, as soon as we started talking, all those awkwardness seems to melt away.</p>

        <p>After that meetup, we would consistently have one every week, meeting in other places like a restaurant, even going to the mall, just the two of us. We both never really talk about what we are, but we enjoy each other's company.</p>

        <p>Our time together didn't last long.</p>

        <p>It seems like her father, just like mine, work in the type of job that requires them to move around, and her father has been transferred to work in another country.</p>

        <p>She has told me about her father before when we hang out. It seems like she's used to it, as her family has to move every so often to a new country.She also confessed that she already asked his father to stay for an extra year in this country.</p>

        <p><i>"Why?"</i> I asked, confused about the sudden request.</p>

        <p><i>"Well, I... found someone I can't really leave behind."</i></p>

        <p>Her cheeks reddened as she looks away. It took me a few seconds before I realized what she meant, and I also look away for a bit. At some point, our eyes meet, and seconds that felt like infinity passed away.</p>

        <p>We both laughed, and then continue on to another topic.</p>

        <p>The moment has come. She is leaving, and she invited me to see her off in the airport. I meet her family, her father, her mother, and her little sister. I shyly try to speak in their language, and they understand and smiled at my attempt.</p> 
        
        <p>I spoke to each of her family, until the moment comes when I face her. Our eyes once again meet. I can see her cheeks puffy as if she has been sobbing all night. I wasn't sure what my face look like, and I would like to think that I've wiped away all the evidences that I cried myself to sleep last night.</p>

        <p>"Hey-" The words I speak are interrupted as she came barrelling forward and wrapped her arms around my neck. Have I ever told you that our heights are not that far off each other? I have been told by other people that I am pretty tall amongst the boys in my school before, but she almost matched me in height.</p>

        <p>"We have to see each other again." She said, still hugging me. I can hear the hint of her sob between each words, which made me start shedding a tear of my own. "Promise me."</p>

        <p>"I promise." I croaked out. "Either I come to meet you..."</p>

        <p>"Or I come visit you." She finished my words, and she let me go as she look me closely. "I promise." She gives a wide smile, the kind of smile that you can't help but smile back at, which I did.</p>

        <p>"Are we too old for pinky promise?" I said half-jokingly.</p>

        <p>"Yeah... but what the hell." She giggled as she pulled out her pinky. I sighed and smiled as I pulled out mine and intertwined it with hers.</p>

        <p>We reluctantly let go, and I can never forget the look on her face. It was the brightest smile you can ever muster, and she is still shedding her tears.</p>

        <p>"I don't wanna say goodbye, cause it'll be too awkward when we meet again. See you!" She then turns her back and follow her family, already far away in a hurry to get to their flight.</p>

        <p>And so the plane flew away from this country.</p>

        <p>I cannot contact her for the longest time, even until now... but I know where she is.</p>

        <p>The shadow seems dimmer than the rest, because it's filled with hope that one day I get to meet her again.</p>
