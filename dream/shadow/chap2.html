        <p>The Second was my cousin, my older cousin.</p>

        <p>I shared a school with her during my Junior High School, and yes, it's another woman. I swear, not all of my shadows are feminine in nature.</p>
        
        <p>We only have a difference of one year in age, and I often say hi to her when we pass by.</p>

        <p>But we're not that close, to begin with. I only know her after meeting her at a regular family gathering. Her father is my uncle, my mother's younger brother.</p>

        <p>One day, something changed between us.</p>

        <p>I was greeting her like usual, but it's not a kind face or a greeting back that I get in return. She was silent instead, and she looked worried.</p>

        <p>The next thing I knew, I was accosted by two students, the same year as me. I know these two in particular, friends of a particularly annoying guy in my class. A famous student, not just because of his looks, but because of his wealth.</p>

        <p>They didn't get into my face about the whole thing, though. </p>

        <p><i>"Hey... so here's the thing."</i> They began explaining. The famous guy is dating someone now.</p>

        <p>I was confused. "What does that have to do with me?"</p>

        <p>Then they revealed that my cousin was the one he was dating.</p>

        <p>I was asked nicely to distance myself away from her. Very nicely.</p>

        <p>"Where can I find this guy?" I was going to yell it out, but I kept myself calm and asked just as calmly as they were doing to me.</p>

        <p>They answered, not knowing what I was about to do. I took off, my heart almost leaping out of my chest. In anger? I couldn't tell.</p>

        <p>As soon as I saw his ugly face in the distance, I began to run. I heard the footsteps of his cronies behind me, following me after I just left them behind.</p>

        <p>It was too late for them to stop me. My fist flew to his cheeks, and he ate it like it was his breakfast for the day.</p>

        <p>That's not the only thing I gave him.</p>

        <p>It was a full-fledged fight. Turns out, he's not all looks, he can dish some as well. We were both wounded before someone stopped the both of us from continuing.</p>

        <p>I remember that in the middle of the fight, we were aggressively yelling at each other. I said that I will not bend my knee to his stupid ass, and he didn't reply, just defending himself and punching me in anger.</p>

        <p>At some point, I do remember telling this coward that she's actually my family, my cousin.</p>

        <p>We were both called to the principal's office, and we're both reprimanded, suspended, and forced to shake our hands in order to "make up".</p>

        <p>After everything is over, and we were out of the office, my cousin approached us. She gets worried over her boyfriend's state, and then she looked at me.</p>

        <p>I never knew that such soft hands can produce quite the slap.</p>

        <p>The slap was loud enough that it echoes off the walls, and it was loud enough that other students stop and stare at us.</p>

        <p>The look she gave me that day is still rattling around in my mind, even now. My cousin never forgave me, and we never spoke again with each other afterwards.</p>

        <p>Even when later on she realized that her boyfriend was not a good guy after all, and they split up, we never made up.</p>

        <p>Every family gathering afterwards is filled with awkwardness, and my mother stopped asking me to join them at some point.</p>

        <p>The shadows line up, waiting for me to remember them.</p>
