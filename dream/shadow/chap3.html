        <p>The Third is my best friend at the time, a boy.</p>

        <p>Not long after I got slapped by the Second, I was no longer able to socialize with people in my school, not without them looking at me with fear and talking behind my back.</p>

        <p>Only one boy was able to treat me normally.</p>

        <p>We have been friends since the orientation period, at the beginning of our Junior High School era. He knows me well enough, and I believe that I know him just as well.</p>

        <p>We often went on hangouts near a PC rental place, or an internet cafe after school, or played soccer together, or playing anything else.</p>

        <p>Playing with him felt the same as playing with my old childhood friend, the First. He almost feels like a replacement of sorts.</p>

        <p>After the incident, there was no change in our friendship. We still talk with each other, and we even discuss about the fight. I explained only half of the reality of the situation, the part that I'm comfortable telling.</p>

        <p>Maybe I should've been more clear to him, or maybe that won't change a thing.</p>

        <p>Soon after, I can feel him distancing away from me. Our usual routine of playing breaks, and one day it even stops.</p>

        <p>We rarely even talk after a while.</p>

        <p>One day, when I had enough of the judging eyes people were giving me, I noticed him talking with one of the cronies of that coward.</p>

        <p>I heard the conversation. <i>"You know him, he's not a good guy..."</i> Just another voice in the sea of people talking about my temper. I almost got myself mad again and wanted to confront him, but I stopped myself. I promised that I wouldn't fight again.</p>

        <p>I stood still and listened on. <i>"Yeah, I mean... I didn't know he was like that..."</i> Turns out he already planned to distance himself away from me after the incident. <i>"He's too aggressive..."</i></p>

        <p>Usually in stories like this, the characters would say that they feel like time stopped for them when they got betrayed like this, but not for me.</p>

        <p>The only person I could trust, that I think could understand me...</p>

        <p>Without thinking, I moved myself to face them. I stare straight into my friend's eyes, and say,<i>"You don't need to be friends with me anymore if you feel like you're forced to be. Thank you for everything."</i></p>

        <p>And I learned to be alone since then, learned to survive against those who judged me for what I did.</p>

        <p>One year later, my Junior High School era ended, and those shadows I left behind as my father moved away to the Capital for work.</p>

        <p>A bright shadow awaits me.</p>
