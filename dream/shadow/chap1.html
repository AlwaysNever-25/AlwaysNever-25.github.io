        <p>Years ago, when my life was simple, the city and all its bluster, and the dreams I dream of achieving yet to bloom in my mind.</p>

            <!--<p>I live in a small city, with a close-knit family. </p>

            <p>And there she was, the First. She was my childhood friend, running towards me giddily as she excitedly said, </p>

            <p><i>"I look for you everywhere, Al!"</i> </p>

            <p>I laughed as she jumps around me and pulled me on, walking towards a nearby park, our playground. <i>"Mum want me to eat first."</i> </p>

            <p><i>"Mrs. Al loves to feed, huh..."</i> </p>

            <p><i>"You should know, she loves it when you come and eat! No one ever clean plates faster than you!"</i> </p>-->
            
        <p>In this hometown of mine, I had a friend. You can say she's a childhood friend.</p>

        <p>Not a day goes by that all our other friends would tease us together. Sticking together for such time, there has to be love that blooms inside in the meantime.</p>

        <p>We were kids back then. We don't get to talk about our relationship, especially love. It was just another funny teasing that never stops.</p>

        <p>But time never stops. It brought us both towards our teenage years.</p>

        <p>Shadows flit by and go away, but this childhood friend of mine remains the biggest shadow of them all. When we both reached high school age, our friendship began to be disturbed by expectations and false appearances.</p>

        <p>High school. It was a time that I can never forget. I didn't think of it that much at the time, but now that I remember, I can't help but groan.</p>

        <p>We both have moved to The City, the capital, at different times. She left first while we were still in Junior High School, and we met again in High School after three years.</p>

        <p>I was surprised to see her appearance now. She's no longer the same person I knew. From her looks to her gait, even the way she speaks. She wore her long dark hair loose, her school costume was tighter than the school rules allowed it to be.</p>

        <p>And she was with many of her friends, who share the same style, so to speak.</p>

        <p>I approached her during my first days, intending to befriend her again. Those eyes do not even look at me, almost like she doesn't recognize that I exist. Like she never knew me at all.</p>

        <p>Life didn't go that well for me after that after I realized something. It doesn't take that long for people to change, it doesn't take long for me to understand just how crude this world can get.</p>

        <p>But other shadows waited for me.</p>
