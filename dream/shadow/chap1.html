            Years ago, when my life was simple, the city and all its bluster, and dreams I dream of achieving yet to bloom in my mind. <br>

            I live in a small city, with a close-knit family. <br>

            And there she was, the First. She was my childhood friend, running towards me giddily as she excitedly said, <br>

            <i>"I look for you everywhere, Al!"</i> <br>

            I laughed as she jumps around me and pulled me on, walking towards a nearby park, our playground. <i>"Mum want me to eat first."</i> <br>

            <i>"Mrs. Al loves to feed, huh..."</i> <br>

            <i>"You should know, she loves it when you come and eat! No one ever clean plates faster than you!"</i> <br>
