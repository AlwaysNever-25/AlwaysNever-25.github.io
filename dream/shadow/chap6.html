    <section>
        <p>At the first day of the last year of my high school, I accidentally bumped someone as I park my bicycle.</p>

        <p>The person I bumped is my sixth shadow. Out of all the shadows I have, he is the one I hate the most, because he is the sole reason why I left high school with a sour taste.</p>

        <p>This boy doesn't take well to my accidental mistake, and his personality reminded me of the coward back at my hometown.</p>

        <p>Unlike that person, however, he is far richer and much more psychotic. He happened to be one of the lynchpin of the infamous students that I previously mentioned, the one that just so happened to spread rumors about me and the Fourth to everyone.</p>

        <p>That accident became the catalyst of a year-long game of cat and mouse between me and his posse, which includes the Fifth. I can see however that his heart is not in it. He can still feel guilt after all.</p>

        <p>After that moment, the whole school became our playground of hide and seek for me and him. My peaceful school life hinges on my ability to hide before the group can find me and rough me up.</p>

        <p>I was only caught unaware the first time they decided to rough me up. After that, I deftly able to dodge them and found myself a safe space somewhere in school, an abandoned room that no one check out for some reason.</p>

        <p>The whole game lasted right until I graduate, but I know for a fact that this "game" will continue to haunt me for the rest of my life. This boy's grudge... no, this <i>bastard's</i> grudge won't be satiated. It will never die down.</p>

        <p>Well... maybe it was because I kind of pranked them back at times, getting them in trouble with the teachers, and even tinkered with their vehicles.</p>

        <p>I laughed hollowly everytime I remember those times. Most people would have nostalgic memories of their high school, but I only remember the time when I have to fight to survive every day.</p>

        <p>There's no one there to help me. No mysterious power that made me a main character. No one in my corner... at least, that's what I think at the time.</p>

        <p>One day, in my attempts to avoid them, I fell on my knees and have to hobble away to my safe hiding spot. As I rest, I realized that I badly hurt my knees, and I just sit there helplessly, holding on to tears of pain and suffering. A whole year avoiding bullies, that's my life for the past year. Pathetic.</p>

        <p>But then I can hear someone approaching. I almost stood up, panicking, thinking of an escape route. If they can find me here out of all places...</p>

        <p>When that long black hair flows freely into my vision, and that shadow I left behind in my hometown and my broken thoughts appear, I was shocked. What is she doing here?</p>

        <p>It was the First. Isn't it enough that she blew me off years ago, when I first approached her? Isn't it enough that she become the school diva, with everyone pining for her? Isn't it enough that this girl happens to date the person responsible for my whole year of suffering?</p>

        <p>And now she just waltz here... with a first aid box in her hands. "Sit," she said as she sat down in front of me, guiding me to follow her suit. I was taken aback by her request, all of my hateful questions suddenly disappear like a puff of smoke. I nodded obidiently and sit down.</p>

        <p>She started treating my wound while I grimaced in pain. As she cleans up my wound, all of the words left unsaid came out, as I can no longer hold them back.</p>

        <p>"So, <i>now</i> you recognize me?"</p>

        <p>I was ready to tell her off, but then our eyes meet. I can see guilt beneath her eyes, and I mustered a look that made it clear what I feel about her actions. Betrayed.</p>

        <p>"Yeah," she said curtly.</p>

        <p>"Where have you been?"</p>

        <p>"I never went anywhere."</p>

        <p>"Why... why now?"</p>

        <p>She went silent, and then continue to clean up my wound as she started to cover it with bandages. She doesn't say anything while doing so.</p> 
        
        <p>I was about to continue but I was interrupted.</p>

        <p>"I can't keep up the charades anymore." She said softly, wading through the silence that blanketed us both after I asked her why. I was stunned to silence by her confession.</p>

        <p>"I'm... I'm sorry for pretending to not know you all these years." She said, as she finished tending to my wound and took all of the bandages and antiseptic in the first aid box. She stood up quickly without saying anything, and began to walk away.</p>

        <p>I grit my teeth and stood up as well, withstanding the pain, and stops her, holding her shoulder. "Why do you have to pretend?" The words just came out, along with the tears that I've been holding back ever since she ignored me.</p>

        <p>She doesn't immediately turn to look to me, but once she did, I also noticed tears rolling down her cheek. "I also have to survive here."</p>

        <p>She then walked away from me, my hands reaching up to her empty visage.</p>

        <p>After that, the First's shadow grew bigger, even more so after this meeting. She still pretended to not know me... but I know now that she still cared.</p>

        <p>It doesn't help me at all to survive, so her caring doesn't mean shit to me... but it does settle my heart a little bit. It's not something that I did wrong. I had made it up in my mind that she was avoiding me because of something that I did wrong.</p>

        <p>And with that, my high school time is over. This "game" continues even until the very last day, but they weren't able to do anything during the graduation since my parents (and their parents) are present. At least, my graduation memory is not tainted by this.</p>

        <p>Maybe I should've at least told my parents about this. But they don't need to know. They will never know.</p>

        <p>Because they are the Seventh and the Eighth shadows. The only shadow that haunted me from the day I was born, and perhaps, until they day I die.</p>
