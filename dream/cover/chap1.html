        <p>
            I am fucked. <br>
            
            I am so, truly fucked. <br><br>
            
            That's the sentence that kept bouncing on my mind as I sit there with my new "husband", Mr. Illa, and listening to the new couple's counsel speaking on our newly married arrangement of living in a room that look akin to a standard psychologist's room with couch and all. <br>
            
            When I heard that I was picked to be paired with someone, I feel trepidation. I know it was inevitable. I was almost 30 years old yet remain unmarried, not even in relationship. <br>
            
            At least, that's what I report to the watcher. This almost invisible, permeable device that I have within me at all times as it attach itself to my belongings. There are comparisons to be made to a certain book about my current living condition, one can say it starts with the word "Big" and ends with the word "Brother". <br>
            
            It look different for everyone, and as much as the united government would like to claim that it doesn't record audio of our life, I would never be able to live without it now. It was required for payment, identification, and basically functioning for day-to-day life. It serves as a replacement for my phone, my ID, and also... my social media. <br>
            
            Gone the days where social media are separate and competing, now it's all melding into a singular network that almost works like all of them combined. I can post status and look for networking for a job, or watch videos in the Videos section. <br>
            
            Or, as I say, "report" about my relationship status. <br><br>
            
            "...Ms. Illa?" <br>
            
            I did not notice that the counsel is calling for me, in a name I did not realize. Then it hit me. I sheepishly smiled as I pay attention to them. <br>
            
            "I'm sorry... that's something I have to get used to now, isn't it?" <br>
            
            The counsel laughed it off and say, "You are not the first one to space out during this session, miss, you don't need to worry." <br>
            
            My new husband, Mr. Illa, laughed as well, albeit a bit more awkwardly. I noticed that he looked to my arms as if he's thinking of doing something, perhaps to comfort me. I almost rolled my eyes before I grabbed his hand. <br>
            
            I have to play my part now. <br>
            
            The counsel noticed the... sweet... gesture and continued with a small awkward cough, "Anyway... your belongings have been deposited to the new place, along with, as you know, a new watcher designed for those that we paired. I hope my explanation regarding the mandatory audit and features on the new place have been satisfactory." <br>
            
            I feel Mr. Illa's hands tightly grip me when the counsel mentioned the "mandatory audit", but he stopped soon afterwards. What was that about? <br>
            
            "It has been, Mr. Joel." My husband said with a smile too wide to be called normal. <br><br>
            
            We both stood up and bowed, as Mr. Joel the counsel do the same, and I followed my husband as he did not let go of my hand. <br>
            
            "Mr. Illa." I said slowly as we walked down the hall outside the counsel room, towards our accomodation to reach the new place. "Can you let go of my hand? I can walk by myself." <br>
            
            He turned around to look at me and blushed slightly as he let go of my hand. "Ah, I apologize... do you prefer if I don't..." <br>
            
            I nodded to him as I walk forward, whispering softly. "We don't have to be affable when we're alone, Mr. Illa." <br>
            
            I didn't see his expression, but I can feel him hurriedly followed behind me. "I... see. But at the very least... you can call me Grant." <br>
            
            "I will do no such thing." I shook my head fervently, not even looking back. <br>
            
            This is a marriage of convenience. I'll play my part, but only when it was appropriate. <br>
            
            "If we are going to make this work..." He said, and I can hear his exasperated tone. "...at the very least, we should get used to calling each other our first name." <br>
            
            I stopped as he said that and turned to look to him, and seeing his desperate face, a memory seems to overlap my vision at that moment. A familiar face, overlaying Mr. Illa's, and I caught the gasp that was about to come out of my throat, before I cover it up with a small cough. <br>
            
            I looked away as well. He's in a better place now, hopefully with someone better. I should stop thinking about him. <br>
            
            "You're right. I guess... you can call me Kisako." <br>
            
            I eyed him from the side, and noticed his eyes lightening up slightly. "Nice to meet you, Kisako." He then offers his hand with a small smile. "I will be in your care." <br>
            
            I look at his extended arm and then back to him again, before sighing and meets it with my own hand. "Perhaps... I will be in your care too, Grant." <br>
