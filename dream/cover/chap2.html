            She doesn't seem to hate me that much.<br>
        
            That's the only thought I can gather after being together with Kisako for a few days. For as sudden as our pairing was, according to the program of the united government, it seems like their algorithm managed to pair a like-minded individual.<br>

            It pains me to admit that, since this is not exactly what I wanted for my life as well, but it was inevitable. I was unable to properly become a member of society, with no partner to report to the watcher, as I reached the age of thirty-one.<br>

            Such is what I reported, not entirely the truth, however.<br><br>

            The morning of the third day comes, and I woke up, with Kisako beside me. She is wearing a white pajamas given by the government, that I also wore, which should be replaced as soon as we enter the workforce available to couples in the coming days. Her long black hair seems to invade portion of my bed that we partitioned off, decided during our first night together.<br><br>

            "Do we really have to do this?" I remember saying that to Kisako, who stared at me like I just disrespected her.<br>

            "Yes. You should consider yourself lucky that I still am willing to let you sleep on the same bed with me." She then said with a low voice. "This is still an act."<br>

            I sighed. "Yes, I understand that. I just thought this to be a bit... excessive, that's all." I looked at the partition, extra pillows taken from under the bed, which makes it look more like a "pillow fort's wall" than anything.<br>
