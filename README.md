# AlwaysNever-25.github.io
## What is this repo?
Basically my portfolio website. Also containing a story made in Stickverse, adapting the origin of the world, at least a version of it.

## What is a Stickverse?
A universe that I made up, consisting of characters and worlds that I have made up for the last decade, almost.

## What kind of project are you aiming to do?
I would love to make an interactive fiction game based only on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Mockups of website design that I can use later perhaps for a family business. Maybe do a blog, or release snippets of the master list of characters I made in Stickverse.

## I read about you diving into Wikia-now-Fandom, why are you so obsessed?
Shut up.
