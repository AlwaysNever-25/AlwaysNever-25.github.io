## What is this repo?
A personal website built with raw HTML/CSS/JS and hosted on Github Pages, to put all of my semi-personal work (mostly creative writing) into the wider internet, and host some of my portfolio (websites).

## What is this "Contracts Review" page?
The "Contracts Review" page is a page where I put all of the reviews I made for the Contracts event in the Anicord Event Server, an event where I am required to consume specific media (mostly Japanese media like anime or manga, but can rarely include Light Novels and Games) and provide my opinion regarding the media. Most reviews are text-only with minimal images, as they are mostly copied from Google Docs and Discord posts and pasted straight into the webpage. However, there are experimental reviews made with creative applications of JavaScript and/or CSS.

## What is a Stickverse?
Stickverse is the fictional universe where 99% of my stories take place, with characters taking the appearance of stick figures. (Yes, I suck at drawing so they're all just stick figures.) It was my main focus when I first created this website, but it has since taken a secondary spot as I focus more on web dev and reviews.

Major work in the Stickverse unreleased to the website include a Stickverse world book consisting of a novella regarding the first 100 years of the world, details of the nature of Stickverse itself and worlds that it contains, major characters and weapons all around the Stickverse, and the general timeline of the stories that take place in the Stickverse. There are also four-part stories regarding an incident where famous swordsmen all around Stickverse were massacred, a story about a world drowned in shadows and cities that survive by being perpetually given artificial sunlight, a story about jackets giving powers, an epic fantasy about seven heroes from seven worlds facing a multi-world company bent on seizing the powers of fate itself, and many others.

## What is the "Daily" page?
The "Daily" page was the place where I hosted my writing project for 2024, a "Daily" blog. It has since moved to their own website/blog.
