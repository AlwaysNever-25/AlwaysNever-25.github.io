# AlwaysNever-25.github.io
## What is this repo?
Basically website where I put my stuff in. Also containing unfinished stories made in Stickverse, something I made that was dated pre-MCU (but not pre-comic book).

## What is a Stickverse?
A universe that I made up, consisting of characters and worlds that I have made up in the last decade, almost.

## What is Contracts Review?
Review I made regarding anime/manga/game during the Contracts event in the Anicord Event Server. They used to be put on google docs, but now they're available in a more unique format, with perhaps more unique experience.

## Do you have a job?
Obviously not, otherwise I'd be out there doing something more worthwhile.
