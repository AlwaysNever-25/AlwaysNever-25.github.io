                <p>Quentino Qiraq is a Power Fruit researcher, who ate the first artificial fruit ever created by human hands, the Quentin Fruit. The fruit, however, grants him the power to infect people with a viral infection, dubbed the "Quentin Virus". This power immediately brought chaos to the Earthworld, due to its quick spread and difficulty in creating a cure to combat it. The chaos grew so much that The Creator were forced to appear for the first time since the Master Knife incident years prior, and brought Quentino deep underground in a special holding place, not risking his power to infect the Deleted World by deleting him.</p>
