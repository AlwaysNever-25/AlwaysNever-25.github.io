Ned found the sword in his backyard after a mysterious meteor shower hit his city, the byproduct of Master Knife's vicious rampage. He is rumoured to have killed 1000 challengers for his title, all of them former member of the 100 Good Swordsmen. It is also rumoured that he has direct contact with The Creator through his sword, as the sword is one of The Creator's Gifts.</p>
