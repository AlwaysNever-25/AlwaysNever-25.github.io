            <p>You ever wonder the steps it takes to love a chuuni? It goes like this:</p>
            <p>Step 1: Be a chuuni yourself, or at least, a former chuuni.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Match the energy of the chuuni, or in this anime's case, deny it and hold her back from going too far.</p>
            <p>Step 3: Naturally gets closer to the chuuni in the process.</p>
            <p>Step 4: ???</p>
            <p>Step 5: Profit.</p>

            <p>It's <i>that</i> easy... or is it?</p>

            <p>Delusion, according to Oxford dictionary, means a false belief or judgment about external reality, held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. Within Japanese media fandom, we fellow weebs have been (over)exposed to one kind of delusion over and over; Chunibyou. The delusion of grandeur often exhibited by middle schooler, with the name literally meaning "Middle School Second Year syndrome", or "Eight-Grader Syndrome".</p>

            <p>We see chuunibyou becoming the most powerful being in the universe (Eminence in Shadow, Fire Force), we see chuunibyou in games, spouting cryptic stuff that goes against the lore of that game universe (Fischl from Genshin, Guillotine from NIKKE, Rappa from HSR).</p>

            <p>But when does this term starts to get known by people in the first place?</p>
