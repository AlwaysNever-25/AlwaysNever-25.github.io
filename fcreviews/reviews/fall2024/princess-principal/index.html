            <p>Okay so... imagine Spy x Family but it features Alya in her high school era, with fellow spies, assassin from Japan... and her secret twin that we never knew about.</p>

            <p>I'm not gonna say that describe Princess Principal. For starters, there is no Loid or Yor here, just one chaperone doing an impression of <i>21 Jump Street</i>. Second of all, this world is really... bleak. It almost felt like it's set on Berlin but it's actually London instead.</p>
