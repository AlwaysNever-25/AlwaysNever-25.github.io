    <h1>For the Love of Books</h1>

    <p class="hidden part1"><i>"This is the beginning of a new epic!!"</i></p>
    
    <p class="hidden part2"><i>"A tale of adventure that you are about to spin!!"</i></p>

    <p class="hidden part3"><i>"What scenes will appear on the pages spread before you?"</i></p>

    <p class="hidden part4"><i>"At times you may want to look away. But..."</i></p>

    <p class="hidden part5"><i>"...you mustn't forget!"</i></p>
    
    <p class="hidden part6"><i>"Yours is the only hand... that can turn the page!"</i></p>
    
    <div class="hidden part7">
        <p>Do digital texts considered a proper form of texts? I would argue that it is. Even if the information provided exists in a sphere of reality that are beyond physical form or any other kind of writing appliances can give. I want to argue that digital texts are an evolution of texts.</p>

        <p>That lamentation are nothing more than something fancy I thought about after I finished this series. I didn't think a series about being a librarian would make me this retrospective. <i>Magus of the Library</i>, however, has shown me that it is possible.</p>

        <p>From first glance, I can tell that this series is special. And no, not because of how beautiful the art is, or how lovable the MC (Theo Fumis) and relatable his story is, and the one character that said the quote at the top of the page, Sedona Bleu.</p>
        <p>This story is yet another one that tackles the theme of literatures, but in the angle of libraries. A state being controlled by librarians, the effect of genocide (in the same vein as *Frieren*, but as prevalent as *Avatar: The Last Airbender*), and various characters and their dreams, and how they interact with each other in their struggle to achieve it.</p>
