    <h1>La casa di Morgan la fata</h1>
    <p>Wikipedia states that Fata Morgana is a complex mirage existing in a narrow band above the horizon, taken from the Italian translation of Morgan Le Fay, or Morgan the Fairy. The optical phenomenon occurs when light bends due to differences in temperatures, and their appearances can change quickly and dramatically.</p>

    <p>Hot and cold. Illusions. Darkness and light.</p>
        
    <p>In the mansion with many names, numerous doors are existing as part of the mansion. From the door to a garden, the cellar, the playroom, or the mysterious tower, it carries with itself life in multitudes of eras. With each era, the mansion has different masters and different stories. Different tragedies that befell them, but all of them have one thing in common.</p>
        
    <p>Love. The one thing that ties them all together. Obsessive love, stubborn love, pathetic love, pure love.</p>
        
    <p>And hate. Eternal hatred. Cycle of hatred. How they both influence the others.</p>
        
    <p>It is with this that I preface the reviews of the visual novel The House in Fata Morgana. A tragic story spanning hundreds of years, across different periods, but set in one place, one setting. The House/Mansion itself.</p>

    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <p>You woke up in a rocking chair, a fireplace on your right, and a pale maid looking at you with a gentle smile.</p>

    <p>You probably have heard these first few words, or variations of them, on many works before, so you might scoff at such a beginning. But this is how Fata begins, with me as a reader, and The Maid, waiting for me to wake up.</p>
        
    <p>At the outset, I was immediately captured by the atmosphere of the art. Itâ€™s not at all detailed, on the contrary, it is very messy, like a painting made by a 10th-century artist who has never experienced the Renaissance yet, but it drives in the point of how dilapidated the setting the story took place. The Mansion itself, abandoned, has found its new master, and that master was me.</p>
        
    <p>Maybe not me, but this unknown male character, that the maid has been waiting for, for a long time. Without our memory intact, the Maid then invites us to explore the Mansion, to piece together our memories so that we can properly become the master of the Mansion. She gave us a tour of the mansion itself, passing through the stained-glass window and mirrors, and arrived near the garden.</p>
        
    <p>This short beginning was enough to fully immerse me within the story itself and got me caught up in the mystery of who is our protagonist, and what kind of story we will experience to get him to remember himself.</p>
        
    <p>The smell of roses fills the air as we open the first door.</p>
