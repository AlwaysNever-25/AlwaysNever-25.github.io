    <h1>Now You See Me, Now You Don't</h1>
    <p><i>Ladies and gentlemen! I bring you marvelous reviews to make your day! What miraculous words await over the unrelenting light of your monitor today?</i></p>

    <p><i>Ooooh, KID!</i></p>

    <p>Alright, alright, settle down, settle down. No, I’m not the Phantom Thief himself, I’m just AlwaysNever, or Al for short. I know, I know, disappointing. But he’s off stealing big jewels again, who knows where, so you’re gonna have to deal with me tonight!</p>

    <p>No, I can’t really show you a magic trick using just mere words… What am I, a master novelist? Even if I can, I wouldn’t do it, because my goal tonight is to present to you my review of the Phantom Kid’s series, Magic Kaito 1412!</p>

    <p>Okay, I heard your internal boo, it crosses through space and time, so much so that I can hear it while I’m still typing the words you’re reading. Maybe that’s the magic trick I’m showing you for this review. Who knows.</p>

    <p>Anyway, to watch this series, I endeavor myself with the extra preparation by reading the manga itself. I have read the manga before, or so I thought, because reading them again after a while, I don’t particularly remember the story as well as I thought.</p>

    <p>So let’s just say I read it for the first time! Ehm…. moving on.</p>

    <p>And would I say reading the manga enhances the experience of watching the anime? Not particularly. Usually, you might think that this is because the adaptation took liberties and changed things around for the sake of a coherent plot, but with this anime, they didn’t just do that, they even adapted things that aren’t supposed to be from the manga, but from the adjacent but more successful Detective Conan.</p>

    <p>That’s right, some of the episode in this anime pulls from a chapter of that incredibly long series.</p>

    <p>But fear not, if you think that’d be a sore spot for me, because I happen to be one of the few readers who did read that manga. Matter of fact, I know Kaito Kid from this manga. But you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who knows Magic Kaito first before they know Detective Conan, because even though Magic Kaito came out as the first serialization by the GOAT Gosho Aoyama, the series itself was dead in the water as he moved on to work on his more popular series Yaiba, and then Detective Conan.</p>

    <p>Anyway, that’s enough history lesson for you before we start this review… Wait, didn’t we already start-</p>

    <p>Oh yeah! We did.</p>

    <p>Thurston’s three rules in magic are as follows, according to Google Search, modified by the anime’s interpretation of it:
    <ul>
    <li>You must never spoil your tricks ahead of time</li>
    <li>You must never perform the same trick twice</li>
    <li>You must never reveal the secret of your trick</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This rule was purportedly said by a magician called Howard Thurston, but further research suggested that this might originate from someone else entirely. I have a link, that explained things in Japanese, but the Google Translate feature seems solid enough for me to understand them.</p>

    <p>Useless tangent aside, the first principle was one of the last things Toichi Kuroba said to his son, Kaito Kuroba, as a recording. And true to his words, the anime never betrayed that principle, showing you the trick only after the deed was done. That principle is the only thing that was actively said by him, so the other two was constantly broken at every opportunity, possibly for the sake of story and entertainment.</p>

    <p>But magic as an entertainment is not the only thing that this series explore. It deals with sorcery as well, <i>real</i> magic. It also deal with technology. Rival magicians, hustlers, detective<i>s</i>, thieves, and organization hell bent on retrieving a jewel that purportedly can bring eternal youth.</p>

    <p>This anime is not the best animation wise, I can concede on you on that, but they knocked it out of the park with the soundtrack and the overall <i>entertainment</i> value.</p>

    <p><i>It's true that magic tricks may only deceive people. But the audience... is there to enjoy the deception. That's the difference between spells and tricks.</i> - The Scarlet Temptress (Episode 5)</p>

    <p><i>Until the next review. Let’s meet again beneath the marvel of the contracts season. See you… next season!</i></p>
