            <p><i>86: Eighty Six</i> is a war series that I didn't expect, but yet somehow I should have. When I first watch this series, three series came to mind immediately that I have experienced before; Red Rising, All You Need Is Kill, and to a lesser degree, Top Gun.</p>

            <p>It does not take me long to love this series. The dual POV and how each POV blend into each other is expertly weaved to make the series so compelling, with each protagonist of each POV being so interesting. A somehow pure ojou-sama who is a rising ranking officer in the empire, and the cool, calm, and collected Captain of the... "undesirables", the Eighty-Sixes.</p>

            <p>Not much about this story that I should reveal to you. This story is too good for me to spoil you, so I'll just say aspect of the presentation that I really enjoyed. I enjoyed their use of smash cut to deliver the maximum emotional impact of a scene, which I can surmise is probably something that they adapt straight from the novels. I really love that they make sure to include nuance in a topic that would be very incendiary otherwise, and portrays topic in both idealistic point of view, and realistically. I very much enjoyed the action piece, which is mostly mecha but they're so cool!</p>
