        id: "At the end, especially right after a specific sequence of events related to phone, I realized that this movie is good enough, but it doesn't move me too much. I wasn't overwhelmed, but the story is good enough that I think everyone should consider watching this... but I'm not gonna push for them to watch it too hard. It's good enough, though!",

        title: "But, this movie is not without its fault.",
        id: "<br>The story felt a bit rushed to me, and my fears were proven to be true after I talked to someone who has read the novel. <br><br>Apparently they cut a story arc involving a bully that Hanashiro punched earlier in the movie, relegating her to a silent cutscene where she apologized to her. <br><br>I didn't realize that, which can be interpreted as the story being written so seamlessly that I don't know any better, but now I wonder how much the movie might feel better if they allow the story to breathe a little.",

Like, they're not cutting the budget on this. <br><br>Every scene felt like something I can put on as my PC wallpaper, and each time I tried looking for a gif from this movie, I started to get mesmerized again by the quality.",

You can spend 10 minutes inside the tunnel, and walk out of it realizing that it's been more than a week ever since you enter the tunnel.",
