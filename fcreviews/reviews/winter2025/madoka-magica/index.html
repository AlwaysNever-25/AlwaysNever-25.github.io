        <p><i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>is a show about magic, wishes,</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>their consequences, and how far</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>someone would go to endure them.</p>

        <h2>I have heard of this show before getting contracted to watch it.</h2>
        <p>I know that this show is about magical girls, but delving into a much deeper topics than my impression of other "magical girl" shows. I was given an option between three shows and decided to pick this one even though I was a bit scared to jump into it.</p>

        <p>I'm no stranger to "dark" shows, but a "dark" magical girl show is something that I don't feel like I can enjoy, mostly because I rarely watches magical show in general, so I cannot appreciate how this will deviate from the tropes of magical girls shows.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="left">
        <h2>I still ended up picking this show.</h2>

        <p>Because this show still intrigues me. Why does everyone love Akemi Homura so much? Why is this show so beloved? Why does <i>Magia</i> is a fucking banger? (Yes, Magia is the biggest part of why I picked this series. That song is so unbelievably good.)</p>

        <p>They're surreal, otherwordly, unlike the goofy monsters you might think when you think of shows from this genre. And above all, they are <i>dangerous</i>. They have the power, and now they're responsible to fight them off, or innocent people will die.</p>

        <h2>Magic is not magic without consequences.</h2>
        <p>Or rather, the best description of this that I can find is Sanderson's Second Law. Limitations are more interesting that power, and in this series case, magical girls are more interesting when we know what makes them tick, their flaws, and their consequences of becoming magical in the first place.</p>

        <p>I realized when I first watched this series, <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>, that this is an exploration on that aspect of a story that is probably rarely explored at the time in other "magical girl" shows. What comes after obtaining power?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Obtaining power means being responsible for the duties it brings.</h2>

        <p>We all know the Spider-Man quote. "With great power comes great responsibility." <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i> shows that magical girls are risking their life to fight the witches, the extra-terrestrial being that is depicted masterfully by SHAFT in a way that makes me shiver.</p>

        <p>They're surreal, otherwordly, unlike the goofy monsters you might think when you think of shows from this genre. And above all, they are <i>dangerous</i>. They have the power, and now they're responsible to fight them off, or innocent people will die.</p>

        <p>When I get scared or hurt,</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>there's no one I can talk to.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>All I can do is cry on my own." - Mami</p>

      <section class="left">
        <h2>It is a lonely fight.</h2>
        <p>It surprises me a bit when they start showcasing loneliness of being a magical girl through the character Mami Tomoe. When I start to think about it, in this world, she is basically a soldier fighting against aliens with her life on the line almost every week, or every day.</p>
        
        <p>The reveal that she <i>has</i> to do it to survive as well (due to the corruption of the soul gem) horrifies me to the core. She has no one to turn to after obtaining her power, no one she can lean on, no support. She's been fighting all alone...</p>
      </section>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"...That's too cruel!</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Mami-san has been fighting all alone</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>for a long time</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>for everyone's sake!" - Madoka</p>
      </blockquote>

      <section>
        <h2>Being magical girls is not just for anybody.</h2>
        <p>Nothing showcases that more than after what happened to Mami in episode 3. That changes the vibes I feel about this show instantly. It's already different from episode 1, ever since they show me the horrifying visuals of the witches, but to show how dangerous the witches really are, it dawns on me that this is unlike anything I could have expect.</p>

        <p>To be chosen, to wish for a miracle, to obtain magical powers, it all has a price. And by episode 6 I realized the cost is their humanity.</p>
