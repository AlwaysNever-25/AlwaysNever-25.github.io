                    <p>I've never grilled this many times in my life. Reading this series makes me want to up that number a bit.</p>

            <p><i>Yaiteru Futari</i>, or <i>How to Grill Our Love</i> has been sitting in my planned-to-read list for the longest time. I was interested in the art, I like the premise, and so the question remains.</p>

            <p>What took me so long to finally read this?</p>
            <small>Procrastination, it's always procrastination. Moving on...</small>

            <p>It was a joy to see these couple grow together through numerous grill sessions. Chihiro's blend of being cool office lady hiding a soft personality underneath is something I always enjoyed, while Kenta's one track mind regarding grilling is quite funny to gawk at.</p>

            <p>These two couples reminded me of that couple from <i>We're New At This</i>, about a newlyweds that still hasn't done it after being married for a while.</p>

            <p>Let's just say... these couple did not take long to cross that border. Oh, <i>boy</i>. Is this what they mean by Reiwa-era romance? I'm all in, baby!</p>

            <p>It was quite a treat to see them grow to love each other's company, worked their differences (Kenta's reaction to their first fight is pretty cute, actually), and all of them accompanied by tons of grilling.</p>

            <p>I'm not kidding with this, it seems like every chapter are contract-bound to feature at least one grilling session. I'm learning new stuff about grilling because of this series alone. Marinating meat, making your own sausages, how to control heat with coal grill, how to cook with portable stove...</p>

            <p>It takes me back to times when my family would grill meat themselves, but as a brat that I am, I would not be there when they're preparing meats and such. I know it is an involved process, but it's fascinating to see...</p>

            <p>And also kinda shaking in my boots at the amount of money they are spending to do all these. Is this what it feels like to actually have a high-paying job and able to just... do what you want?</p>

            <p>This series also has a lot of interesting side characters, like Chihiro's boss Fushimi-san, Kenta's colleagues Toda and Mifune, Rina-chan the gyaru, and also Chihiro's father. I am particularly interested in the budding friendship between Fushimi-san and Toda... age-gap romance and them being belligerent with each other?</p>

            <p>One way or another, we will see them kiss at some point. They're already given a chapter where they have their own grilling session too! I'll definitely continue reading the series to see where they end up!</p>

            <p>Either way, this series has been a lot of fun. A grounded and mature romance with the backdrop of grilling. I'll give it a <b>8/10</b> for now. I can foresee it going higher as I catch up to the currently released chapter.</p>
