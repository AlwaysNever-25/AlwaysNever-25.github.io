            <p>This Summer (or rather, starting earlier in Spring but continuing to Summer), I went ahead and assembled the most ambitious choices since Winter 2024 Contracts; an Anime-filled Marathon.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's also innumerable amount of mangas (and LNs too!) that I'm currently reading. The amount that I'm currently reading is... a little bit too much for me to put in a single post, but I just want to showcase how MUCH ANIME I AM CONSUMING FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. This is not even counting the contracts anime (86, Madoka Magica, Link Click, Tunnel to Summer, Sword Art Online Progressive movies) and... some other stuff I cannot mention here.</p>

            <p>"Summer Break" is a bit of a misnomer though, because... I'm still working as of this time. My initial expectation is that I will be free during this time, but... I am not.</p>

            <p>And after this monster of a season, I signed up for something even bigger than this entire roster of Anime Marathon.</p>

            <p>In the upcoming <i>Contract Season X</i>... I signed up for <small>(almost)</small> EVERY SINGLE CONTRACT THAT ARE OFFERED.</p>

            <p><small>That one special is too scary for me to take. I'm already doing something crazy by taking everything here (that are not game contracts).</small></p>

            <p>Base Contract. Challenge Contract. Veteran Special (Path of Peak). Duality Special (Yang Path). Epoch Special (Path of Progeny). Honzuki Special (Path of the Novelist). Buddy Special. Aid Parade.</p>

            <p>That's eight contracts that I signed up for. One of these will be LNs. Most of these will be mangas. Aid Parade can be anything.</p>

            <p>I will not waver. I am already sure this will be my last time ever doing contracts, because there is no way I will complete every single thing that I signed up for.</p>

            <p>I don't have fighting words. I have no promises. ESPECIALLY since recently I started some new gacha games, and some hidden stuff that I cannot divulge just yet. I also have a goal to pass JLPT N4. I also also need to finish some stuff regarding my college (I am graduating this November!).</p>

            <p>This has been quite the summer indeed.</p>
            
            <p>Or rather... I cannot believe what a year this has been.</p>
