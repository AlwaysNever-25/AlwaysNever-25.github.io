            <p>Welcome to Omniscient Reader's View- wait, no. No no.</p>

            <p>Na Kang-Lim is NOT Omniscient. He's smart, has charisma, and will go through great lengths to keep people he care about safe... but he's NOT the main character. He doesn't look handsome, he's a gamer, and he's not physically gifted, like the main character of this webtoon he reads!</p>

            <p>Well, to be fair, neither does Dokja... and he might be Omniscient, but he is also smart, has charisma, and will go through great lenghts to keep people he care about safe... but he is definitely handsome though. AND physically gifted. And he's kinda the main character...</p>

            <small>Okay yeah if I continue this, you wouldn't really get the reference to <i>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</i>, so I'll stop here.</small>

            <p>What took me so long to finally read this?</p>
            <small>Procrastination, it's always procrastination. Moving on...</small>

            <p>A romcom with a meta narrative that riffed off ORV? Literally the dream. I'm a sucker for romcom, as my anilist profile have shown. (As of writing this, I have 271 entries of Romance, and 198 entries of Comedy, that is visible on my anilist profile. I am a BIG sucker for romcom.)</p>

            <p>This series then also mixed it up by giving the MC, Na Kang-Lim... loop powers? Is this now a Re:Zero but romance?!</p>

            <p>But seriously though, as the series progress, we get to be introduced to the heroines of the webtoon that Kang-Lim read, <i>Escape: Six Wives</i>, starting with his favorite heroine, Yoo Da-Hee. Her being a twist on the good girl archetype is pretty fun to watch, especially Kang-Lim crestfallen response knowing how Da-Hee really is.</p>
