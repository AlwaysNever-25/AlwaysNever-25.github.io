        <p>"So... you want to speak with them.</p>

        <p>"Indeed."</p>

        <p>"Even after-"</p>

        <p>"Yes, even after I knew of their transgression. Don't you see how interesting this is? Worlds beyond our own, your <i>own</i> creation, yet the way they act under pressure is no different." She said, cutting me off. Here we go, she would probably go on another tangent.</p>

        <p>"We were made different, prolonged life, sure. You, with the equivalent of what I should call God-like power on your hands. Yet we both knew that deep down we are nothing more than elevated humans. Now, here we are, seeing how despicable these...  people you made. You were sure that they would be different, but once we put them under the microscopic attention, their culture... their social hierarchy... it's no different!"</p> 

        <p>She slapped her hand down to my marble table.</p>

        <p>"These aren't just <i>your</i> creation, God. These are people, just like us!"</p>

        <p>I shook my head. "They are not the same as us, Victoria. At least, not anymore."</p>
