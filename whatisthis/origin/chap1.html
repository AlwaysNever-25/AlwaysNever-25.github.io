        The Creator sat in his seat, looking at all the mess.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The worlds were still unstable. The Desert is still too hot, the Ocean is only started to form. The Mountain were grumbling from beneath, and the Sky was still in progress.
        </p>

        <p>
        But it is, in the very bare minimum, alright. Still far from what he imagined, but he have plenty of time for growth.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is still a new world, a world that he creates. The world in which he controls everything. The rest of the group is exploring and adding their own touch to the world.
        </p>

        They all went their separate ways, but of course not the married couple. They, and also another person, helped me with some of the finer details of the world. In the process, they gained their own knowledge of the worlds and unique powers. I didn't mind at all, they were very helpful.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Unlike the other people. One went around the worlds in an attempt to discover new methods of things he did in the real world. Another one went around the worlds to challenge anyone in a fight, now that his body is altered to the strongest way possible. And the last one went alone to journey the worlds, without any goals or apparent needs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But He is unable to track the last person, with our unspoken agreement to never track each other. He was left with literally no clue as of where she goes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The agreement. One of the things He come to regret the longer He went living in this world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The 'no tracking' rules were only a part of what was officially named the Agreements of Six. The agreement made between six person who creates this world. This agreement should never come to be, because He thinks only about half of the people here actually do the hard work.

        The married couple were the greatest writer he ever seen. With their imagination, they bring forth their ideas to life. The other guy was once a game designer, so both of them carry this project to its intended purpose and designation. 
        </p>

        The doctor was only brought to realise the biological part of the project. And the other 2 person was only made into this team because the investor said so.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Funding was rough at the very first days of the project's conception, but they got lucky. An investor was willing to bring boatloads of money to our pocket if and only if they were allowed to add persons to our team. The doctor was one, a decision we all agree with and didn't even think of when we first create the concept.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The other two persons were not what He thought this project needs. A sociologist and physical trainer?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        He had an inkling that whoever funded this only planted the trainer as a person that can report to them clandestinely, but He is still flabbergasted as to why they wanted a sociologist.
