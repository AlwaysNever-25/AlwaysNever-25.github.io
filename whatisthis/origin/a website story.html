			The world.
			</p>

			<p>
			Not the one he created, but the one he lived in.
			</p>

			<p>
			It was the place he was born, the place where he started living his miserable life. The place where he became a depressed guy and the place where he created a whole new universe.
			</p>

			</br>
			</br>
			
			<p>
			The group.
			</p>
		
			<p>
			Even though he was a loner, he couldn't made the universe on his own. It wasn't easy for him to go back to what he was, but he did. He invited his former friends, the group that he left when he decided to live alone.
			</p>

			<p>
			Six people, including himself, gathered their ideas, skills, thoughts, and work into the project. Sweat was poured, sleep was missed. Coffees were drank and takeouts were ordered. The project was long and tedious, but they keep on working it.
			</p>

			<p>
			Emotions run high, and cracks started to form in the group. The married couple have more fights. The best of friends started to be more snarky in vitriol. The threesome were plagued with suspicions, but the loner kept working. The project takes a toll on everybody but him.
			</p>

			<p>
			Just the thought of the whole new universe kept him going. A whole new start. A whole new world.
			</p>

			<p>
			A whole new beginning.
