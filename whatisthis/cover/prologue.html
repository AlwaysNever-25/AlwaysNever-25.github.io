        <p>When I first saw Kisako Yama, I thought I finally was able to fulfill a lifelong dream. <br>

            Since I was a child, I already decided that I wanted to be with someone. As childish as that thought was, it started to blossom, and bloomed, into a full-blown need to have a partner. <br>
            
            Or at least, paired with someone that I truly love from the first sight, and they also love me at first sight. <br>
            
            The lady in front of me is elegant, beautiful. Straight dark hair, perfectly manicured fingers. Pursed lips, thin figure wrapped in the customary white gown worn by brides, while I stood awkwardly wearing the customary dark suit for a groom. <br>
            
            But that euphoria soon faded, and replace with grim reality, as I saw the glimpse of her looking at me, and I can see it as clear as the sky during daytime. She wasn't fond of me. I was sporting a messy black hair myself, looking pathetic with black bag under my eyes that the make up artist desperately trying to cover, and standing almost hunchbacked. <br>
            
            I sighed inwardly. Of course, it was just a childhood dream. An errant wish that was born out of a child's desire, as useless as a shooting star that nobody witnessed. <br>
            
            "Kisako Yama, do you take... Grant Illa, as your lawfully wedded husband?" <br>
            
            She shifted her eyes towards the ground, making sure not to look around and seeing the many eyes that are observing the ceremony. Or the guards with their weapons. <br>
            
            "I... do." <br>
            
            The arbitrator, as we call those who wed people now, smiled with satisfaction after waiting with bated breath when Kisako didn't reply, and turned towards me. <br>
            
            "And you, Grant Illa, do you take Kisako Yama as your lawfully wedded wife?" <br>
            
            I did not shift my eyes as I look Kisako straight in the eyes, and answered as resolutely as I can. <br>
            
            "I do." <br>
            
            "So by the power bestowed to me by the United..." <br>
            
            The words began to blur after that as we were both ushered away, to take off our gown and suits, then to where? I don't even know. <br>
            
            But, it was official. I am now married... or at least, "paired", to someone else. Someone that I didn't even pick. <br>
            
            Someone that the government arranged for me to marry. <br>
