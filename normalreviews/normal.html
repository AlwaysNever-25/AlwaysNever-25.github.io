    <p><b><i>Reviews</i></b> are made out of my first thoughts after finishing said series, compiled and rewritten to form a coherent review. It can also be made after I reread said review, but those will be noted as <i>Reviews and Retrospectives</i> as well.</p>
    <p><b><i>Retrospectives</i></b> are made out of thoughts I had way after finishing said series. Might contain my first thoughts if I can find them (and will be noted as both <i>Reviews and Retrospectives</i>), but generally would be thoughts that came to mind after the fact.</p>
